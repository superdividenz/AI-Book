# Fix for 404 Error

## Problem
The server was running an old version without the new authentication routes, causing 404 errors.

## Solution

**The old server has been stopped. You need to restart it with the updated code:**

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd ai-book-agent/backend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Verify the Server is Running
You should see:
```
🚀 Server running on port 5050
```

### 3. Test the Auth Endpoints
Once the server is running, you can test:
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user (requires auth token)
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout user

### 4. Check the Frontend
Make sure your frontend is also running:
```bash
cd ai-book-agent/frontend
npm run dev
```

## What Was Fixed

1. ✅ Old server process killed (it was running without the new routes)
2. ✅ All routes properly configured in `server.js`
3. ✅ 404 handler added to return JSON (not HTML)
4. ✅ Error handling improved to always return JSON

## If You Still Get 404 Errors

1. **Make sure the backend server is running** - Check terminal for "🚀 Server running on port 5050"
2. **Check the route** - All routes should be prefixed with `/api/`
3. **Check CORS** - Make sure CORS is enabled (it is in the code)
4. **Clear browser cache** - Sometimes old cached responses cause issues

## Quick Test

Once the server is running, test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"test123"}'
```

You should get a JSON response (not HTML).
